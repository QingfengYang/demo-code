The IntBlock codec is designed to make it easy to experiment with these sorts of different int encoders. It does the "hard part" of enabling Lucene to operate on a set of ints at once, which is somewhat tricky as the seek points (in the terms dict and the skipping lists) must now encode both the file-pointer where the block starts as well as the index (starting int) into the block.
